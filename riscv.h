/* ERR_EXCEPTION indicates that the instruction has raised one of the
 * exceptions defined in the specification. If this flag is set, the
 * additional fields "exc_cause" and "exc_val" must also be set to values
 * as defined in the specification.
 *
 * A common approach to handling exceptions includes:
 *  - Environment call: since the program counter (pc) has already been
 *    advanced, environment calls can be handled by simply clearing the
 *    error after completing the operation.
 *  - Faults: when handling faults, it is important to set
 *    vm->pc = vm->current_pc so that the instruction can be retried.
 *  - Traps: exceptions can be delegated to the emulated code in the form
 *    of S-mode traps by invoking "vm_trap()". This function takes care
 *    of clearing the error.
 *
 * ERR_USER is not set by any "vm_*()" function. It is reserved for user
 * callbacks to halt instruction execution and trigger the return of
 * "vm_step()". If the flag is not set during a fetch operation, the pc
 * will be advanced accordingly.
